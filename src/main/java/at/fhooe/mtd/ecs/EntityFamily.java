/**
 * An entity family specified criteria which must be met by an entity in order
 * to be considered to be a member of this family. This version currently
 * supports a list of component types as criterion, where all types must exists
 * within the entity (and operation).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note</strong>: It is safe to compare different instance of Family
 * objects using the {@code equals} method. Both methods {@code equals} and
 * {@code hashCode} are implemented by this class. This means that Families can
 * be used as keys in associative containers like {@code HashMap} as keys.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An entity family can be created by using the static factory method
 * {@link create} which takes an arbitrary number of parameters that specified
 * the different types of components this family must contain in order to accept
 * an entity as member.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example</strong>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Family f1 = Family.create(Pose.class, Visual.class);
 * Family f2 = Family.create(Pose.class, Collider.class);
 * Family f3 = Family.create(Pose.class, ItemLogic.class, Destroyable.class);
