# Mutual Attraction Simulation

This project simulates mutual attraction using a thread for every mover force count. It leverages the Entity Component System (ECS) framework from [divotkey/ecs](https://github.com/divotkey/ecs/tree/master/Entity%20Component%20System/src/at/fhooe/mtd/ecs).

## Features

- **Multiple Simulations**: Choose from different simulations for N celestial bodies.
- **Control Simulation**: 
  - Pause/Stop the simulation with `P`.
  - Save the state of the simulation with `Ctrl + P`.
  - Load a saved simulation with `Ctrl + S`.
- **Camera Control**: 
  - Change the camera view (zoom in/out) with `Ctrl +` and `Ctrl -`.
  - Move the simulation view with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`.
